# Requierments
You will need to have [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

# Use
When you run the main file it will pop up a graph, thats the company graph that you will trade with. 
You have a inicial balance of 100 units.
You currently have 3 options you can pass a turn by writting 'pasar', you can buy stocks by writting 'comprar', or you can sell by writting 'vender'. 
This will continue in an infinite cycle.
Good luck and i hope you have fun.

# Explaning
The main file is the working simulator, it's a mix of the others files.
"Iniciador" is the file thar actually starts the code and generate the first graph It also generates the "seed" of the "company".
"Refresher" is the piece of code that actually continue creating the "company" graph after you decide what you want to do.
